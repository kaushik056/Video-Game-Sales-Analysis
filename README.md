# Video Game Sales Analysis

Welcome to the **Video Game Sales Analysis** project! This repository contains SQL scripts that analyze a comprehensive dataset of video game sales, providing valuable insights into trends, bestsellers, and market dynamics in the gaming industry.

## Project Overview

In this project, we utilize SQL queries to extract meaningful information from the dataset, answering key questions about video game sales over time. The analysis focuses on several aspects:

- **Top Bestselling Games**: Identifying the top 10 bestselling games of all time, revealing the dominance of franchises like Call of Duty and Grand Theft Auto.
  
- **Publisher Performance**: Analyzing the top publishers based on total sales and the number of games released, highlighting the leading role of Activision and the unique position of Rockstar Games.

- **Sales Trends**: Examining sales trends over the past century, with a notable peak in 2011 and a decline thereafter, culminating in significant lows by 2020.

- **Platform Comparisons**: Comparing sales across different gaming platforms, uncovering insights about Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 despite fewer games, and noting the underperformance of the PC platform.

- **Genre Analysis**: Investigating the correlation between game genres and global sales, demonstrating that Shooter, Action, and Sports genres lead in sales figures.

- **Regional Sales Distribution**: Analyzing sales by region, revealing North America as the highest contributor, with sales surpassing the combined figures of Japan and other regions.

- **Top Regional Games**: Identifying the top 10 games in North America, with the Call of Duty franchise dominating the rankings.

- **Publisher Appearances**: Listing publishers by the number of appearances in the dataset, with Ubisoft and Electronic Arts leading the pack.
